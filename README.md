CS275 Final Project Assighment
Group Member: Ryan Gan, Hanyu Li, Teme Okotete

### For Group Member, follow the instructions below to make changes to work on our project in the future:
1. Open Github Desktop(install if you don't have one, this will be really convienent for you do all things in github such as pull, push, clone, make new branches and etc...)
2. Check the "Current Branch", if this is your first time using Github, the branch displaying should be "master" branch. 
    DO NOT EVER WORK FILES ON THIS MASTER BRANCH!!!!!
    DO NOT EVER WORK FILES ON THIS MASTER BRANCH!!!!!
    DO NOT EVER WORK FILES ON THIS MASTER BRANCH!!!!!
3. You can view all files in the master branch but if you want to make changes, this is what you need to do.
4. Click on "Current Branch" and you should see all the branches. You click on "New Branch", it's going to ask you for the branch name. Give the branch a name that's related to whatever changes you're going to make. For example, if I am going to work on the '''homepage.html''' and '''store.html''' in the client side code, name the branch edithomepageAndstore. 
5. Now you are on your new branch! It will have everything from the master branch. You can make whatever changes you want to make in this branch and it will not affect what's in the master branch.
6. When you're done with your tasks, you save all of the changes and write a commit message and a short description of whatever changes you made on the bottom-left side of the Github Desktop application. Then click "Commit to XXXXX(whatever branch name you created)"
7. Click on the "Push" button on the top side of the application to push your files so every one can see it.
8. Notify us that you have made a change and we can meet up or text in the groupchat and someone in our group is going to view the code you just wrote. If the update works out fine, another group member will go to Petstagram repo in the browser to merge your code to the master branch. (This process is called "getting approval", some TA told me last year. This might be used in our future workforce a lot. IDK if it's true but it is useful for a team project :)) 
9. Sometimes codes added in the new branch is not mergeable to the master branch because they have collision, this is why we need to have seperate branches to work on different tasks so eventually our project will work out without collisions. 
10. Once merged, you should delete the branch that you created. Because if you want to work on something else on the same files then you wouldn't be confused about which branch to get into. 
11. Let me know if you have any problem
